The meme template I used was a basic two row and column set up, where in the first column are two photos and the second column is speech. 
I decided to make my meme about petrol prices, as I am a person that heavily relies on my car to get from place to place. 
Being a student, with limited funds. The steep increase in petrol price has been a huge controversy lately.
I used a photo of Elon Musk, as I thought there was a ironic aspect, being the owner of the biggest electrical motor company.
