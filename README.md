## Quick Introduction

My name is Eric and I am a New Zealand born Korean. Currently I am a student at Auckland University, studying data science. 
As part of my STATS220 course, I am learning to use R code and github. 

This Repo is my first exhibit of the skills I have learnt from the course so far. :)
